Summary bar charts of the ten most enriched genes sets for each of the differential expression signatures. For each plot the -log10 enrichment p-value is given on the x-axis and the gene set name on the y-axis. Data labels represent the number of significantly differentially expressed genes within each gene set. Enrichment analysis was performed using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on the gene set databases <*hypergeom_gene_set_databases*>. Significantly enriched gene sets (p.adj < <*hypergeom_gene_set_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*hypergeom_gene_set_log2fold*>) are coloured red and non-significant black.
