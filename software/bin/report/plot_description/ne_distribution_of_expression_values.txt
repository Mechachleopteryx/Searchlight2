Here we show for each sample the distribution of expression values. Generally these are expected to look highly similar across all samples regardless of sample group, and so are useful for assessing the quality of the experiment technically. Outlier samples with atypical distributions of expression values can be indicative of technical issues with that sample âˆ’ such as insufficient quantities of RNA during library preparation.
