Gene expression data Principal Component Analysis (PCA) contribution of components waterfall plot. Showing all components in ascending order on the x-axis and the contribution of each component on the y-axis. To control for over representation of very highly expressed genes, all gene expression values were scaled on a gene by gene basis using the z-score transformation, prior to the PCA.
