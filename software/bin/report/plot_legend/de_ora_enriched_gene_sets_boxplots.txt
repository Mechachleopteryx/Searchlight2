Summary boxplots of the ten most enriched genes sets for: all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*de_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*de_log2fold*>) between <*de_numerator*> and <*de_denominator*>, significantly upregulated genes and significantly downregulated genes. Upregulated genes are higher expression in <*de_numerator*> than in <*de_denominator*>. For each plot the significantly differential genes within the gene set are given on the x-axis and the expression values on the y-axis. Boxes are shown for the following sample groups: <*sample_groups*>. Expression levels have been scaled into per gene zâˆ’scores. Enrichment analysis was performed using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on the gene set databases <*hypergeom_gene_set_databases*>.
