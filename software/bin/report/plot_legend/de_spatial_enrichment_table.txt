Table showing spatial enrichment statistics for the differentially expressed genes between <*de_numerator*> and <*de_denominator*>. Three measures of spatial enrichment are provided for each chromosome: enrichment of expressed genes (columns 8-9), enrichment of differentially expressed genes (columns 10-11) and bias towards upregulation or downregulation (columns 12-13). The per chromosome gene count statistics from which all statistical analysis is based are also provided (columns 2-7). Upregulated genes are higher in <*de_numerator*> than in <*de_denominator*>.
