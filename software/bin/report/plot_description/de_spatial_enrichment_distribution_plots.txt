Here we provide spatial enrichment distribution plots. These show for each chromosome: the location of each gene and its associated log2 fold change and significance level (left plots), and the overall distribution of significantly different compared to non-significantly different genes (right plots). These plots can be useful to visually confirm any observations shown in the spatial enrichment table.
