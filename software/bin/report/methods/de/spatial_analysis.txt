The spatial enrichment analysis provides three statistical measures for spatial bias. 1) Bias towards gene expression at a given chromosome. The p value is calulated using a fishers exact test as: number of expression set genes in chromosome, number of expressed genes in chromosome vs number of  expression set genes in genome ,number of expressed genes in geneome. 2) Bias towards differential expression at a given chromosome. The p value is calulated using a fishers exact test as: number of differential expression set genes in chromosome, number of differentially expressed genes in chromsome, vs number of differential expression set genes in genome, number of differentially expressed genes in genome. 3) Bias towards either up or downregulation at a given chromosome. The p value is calulated using a fishers exact test as: expected number of upregulated genes at a given chromosome, the number of upregulated genes at a given chromosome, expected number of downregulated genes at a given chromosome, the number of downregulated genes at a given chromosome.
