Here we provide a barchart of the number of significantly up and downregulated genes. The number and direction of the differences between the two sample groups can give insight into the strength and directionality of the difference. If there are many thousands of significantly different genes it can often be useful to increase the stringency of significance, in order to highlight the most important genes.
