One of the core aims of differential expression analysis is to understand which pathways and areas of biology any differentially expresseOver Representation Analysis (ORA). In ORA the significantly different genes are compared to a database (e.g. GO terms, KEGG) of pre-defined lists of genes (gene-sets) - each of which represents a specific pathway or area of biology (e.g. Cell Cycle, TNF signalling). A hyper-geometric test is then used to determine whether each gene-set is enriched or not for the significantly differential genes. The most enriched gene-sets have the lowest p-values.

Here we provide boxplots showing the ten most highly enriched gene-sets, and the expression values for the significantly differential genes within each gene-set. The expression values are given as z-scores. Boxplots of the top ten enriched gene-sets are given for: all significantly differential genes, significantly upregulated genes and significantly downregulated genes. As well providing a useful snapshot of the pathways or general areas of biology that are most affected by the differential expression this also shows how convincing the differences are, and which individual genes within the gene-set are most affected.
