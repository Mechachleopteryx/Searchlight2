Summary boxplots of the ten most enriched, activated and repressed upstream regulators between <*de_numerator*> and <*de_denominator*>. For the enrichment plot enrichment was calculated using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*de_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*de_log2fold*>). The significantly differential genes controlled by the upstream regulator are given on the x-axis and the expression values on the y-axis. For the activated and repressed plots activation was calculated using the IPA-like algorithm (see methods) based on all differential expression values. Boxes are shown for the following sample groups: <*sample_groups*>. Expression levels have been scaled into per gene zâˆ’scores. Upstream regulator analysis was performed on the databases <*ura_databases*>.
