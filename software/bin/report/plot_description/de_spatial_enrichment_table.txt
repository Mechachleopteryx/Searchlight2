The spatial enrichment table gives statistics on the genomic distribution of expressed and differentially expressed genes. It provides three main measures of spatial enrichment: 1) Whether a chromosome has more expressed genes than expected by random chance - taking into account the number of expressed genes globally and the number of genes on the chromosome. 2) Whether a chromosome has more differentially expressed genes than expected by random chance - taking into account the number of differentially expressed genes globally and the number of genes on the chromosome. 3) Whether a chromosome has any significant bias towards up or downregulated genes - taking into account the proportion of upregulated and downregulated genes globally and the number of genes on the chromosome. For more details please see the methods section. Any significant bias may be indicative of spatial or epigenetic regulation at these loci.
