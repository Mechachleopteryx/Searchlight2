Per chromosome differentially expressed genes spatial distribution plots. Showing for each chromosome, Left plots: a scatterplot of the genomic locations of each gene (y-axis) and its log2 fold change between between <*de_numerator*> and <*de_denominator*>. Significantly differential genes (p.adj < <*de_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*de_log2fold*>) are shown in red and non-significant genes in black. Right plots - density plot showing the density of genes by locus across the chromosome. The distribution of significantly differential genes is shown in red and non-significant genes in black.
