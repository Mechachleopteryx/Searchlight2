Here we provide a volcano plot. The volcano plot shows the relationship between the fold change and the associated p−value for each gene. Typically it is expected to see a consistent relationship between fold changes and p−values across all genes. In a volcano plot, the absence of a consistent relationship between fold changes and p−values may suggest problems with the methods used to call differential expression. Volcano plots also provide an idea of the scale, and balance between direction of the changes between two conditions. The left and right plots are identical, except the gene names have been removed from the right plot.
