Here we provide a list of the ten most highly upregulated and most highly downregulated genes by p-value and log2 fold change. This can be useful in some cases for identifying candidate genes. As a rule of thumb, more highly or downregulated upregulated genes tend to be more reliable, and less peripheral to the biological difference between two sample groups. Thus the ten most highly upregulated or downregulated genes can also give a useful snapshot as to the types of genes that differ between the two sample groups.
