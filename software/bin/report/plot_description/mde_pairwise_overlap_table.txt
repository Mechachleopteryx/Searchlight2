The pairwise overlap table summarises the Venn style overlap between the significant genes of two different differential comparisons, for each possible combination of comparisons. Each row in the table represents on overlap analysis, showing the number of unique and overlapping genes and the p-value of the overlap by hyper-geometric test. The table compares the significant genes in a directional and undirectional sense. A highly significant overlap indicates shared differential biology.
