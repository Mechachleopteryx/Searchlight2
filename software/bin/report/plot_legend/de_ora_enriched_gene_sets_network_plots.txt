Network of all significantly enriched genes sets (p.adj < <*hypergeom_gene_set_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*hypergeom_gene_set_log2fold*>), highlighting significance and gene set interconnectivity. Networks are given for enrichment amongst: all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*de_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*de_log2fold*>) between <*de_numerator*> and <*de_denominator*>, significantly upregulated genes and significantly downregulated genes. Enrichment analysis was performed using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on the gene set databases <*hypergeom_gene_set_databases*>. For each network nodes represent gene sets and edges represent two gene sets with a Szymkiewicz-Simpson coefficient of at least <*hypergeom_gene_set_overlap*>. Node colour represents -log10 enrichment p-value, with red as higher significance and white as lower signficance. Node size represents the number of significantly differential genes within the node.
