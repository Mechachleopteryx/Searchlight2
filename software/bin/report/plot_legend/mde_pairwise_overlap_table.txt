Table showing the overlap statistics between the significantly differentially expressed genes for the comparisons: <*mde_comparisons*>. The table shows in each row: the two lists of genes that are being compared to each other, the number of genes in each list, the number of unique genes in each list, the number of genes in common, the overlap p-value and log2 fold enrichment. The overlap p-value was calculated using a hypergeometric test, with all supplied genes as the background.
