## Searchlight 2: rapid and comprehensive RNA-seq exploration and visualisation for unlimited differential datasets.

<br>

**Searchlight 2 aims to automate the data exploration and visualisation stage of RNA-seq differential analysis as far as its possible**, by assuming that most experiments can be simplified into a combination of pre-set workflows, based on the experimental design. In doing so it has the potential to save days, weeks and even months worth of labour and associated resources per RNA-seq experiment - at no loss to specificity. It provides a comprehensive, yet breadth and depth curated selection of results including intermediate and additional files, statistical analysis, extensive visualisation, simple and modifiable r-code, a Shiny app and fully realised reports. It is compatible with any annotated organism and any experimental design regardless of number of samples or complexity. Searchlight 2 is easy to setup and use, has minimal system requirements, and typically runs in under 5 minutes per workflow. We envisage Searchlight 2 to be of use to a wide range of RNA-seq users. Namely project bioinformaticians, RNA-seq service providers and to bench scientists with a cursory understanding of RNA-seq data analysis. Searchlight 2 is available at: https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2.

## Downloading and using Searchlight 2.

To download the software please click the clone/download button above. **A quick start guide alongide a detailed usage guide can be found in the user manual provided with the download.** Searchlight accepts input files that are typical to RNA-seq. Namely a matrix of normalised expression values, a sample sheet, a transcriptome background file and tables of differential expression values (fold, p, adjusted p). Typical Searchlight runcode looks like this:

```
python Searchlight2.py 
--out path=out/
--normexp file=expression_matrix.tsv
--bg file=GRCh38_background.tsv
--ss file=sample_sheet.csv
--pde file=WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT
```

Examples of Searchlight 2s outputs (including several reports) can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Searchlight2/example-reports.
