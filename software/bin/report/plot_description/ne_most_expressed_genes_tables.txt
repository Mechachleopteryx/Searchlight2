Here we provide a list of the ten most highly expressed genes in each sample group. Looking at the most highly expressed genes can be a useful control for the success of the experiment technically - as we often expect many of these to be housekeeping genes (such as ACTB or GAPDH) or cell type specific genes. If the top 10 most highly expressed genes seem surprising or difficult to understand biologically, this can indicate an issue with the sequencing or data processing steps.
