Here we provide a MA plot. The MA plot shows the relationship between the expression of each gene and its fold change. As lowly expressed genes tend to have fewer reads (observations) there is often typically statistical power to call significance at these genes compared to highly expressed genes. This results in a bias. I.e. we less likely to be able to call a gene significantly differential if it is lowly expressed than highly expressed. The MA plot gives us an indication of this effect. An obvious point on the MA plot where low expression correlates with fewer significant genes, suggests an expression cut-off can be used. The left and right plots are identical, except for clarity the gene names have been removed from the right plot.
